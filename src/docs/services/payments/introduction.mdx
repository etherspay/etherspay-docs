# Getting started

## Creating your first project

In order to create your first project you will need to create an Etherspay account, you can create an account at [https://etherspay.com/](https://etherspay.com/login)

Once you made a project you will be able to create payment links, customers, payments, ..

There are different ways to actually integrate Etherspay into your own project such as our REST API or the Javascript SDK

## Add payment methods

Before you can start accepting crypto payments, you must select which crypto tokens you want to accept as a legitimate payment method.

You can manage your payment methods in your payment settings.

Before adding any token, you need to have at least one active network.

- Ethereum
- Binance Smart Chain
- Polygon
- Testnets

## Javascript SDK

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { Etherspay } from "@etherspay/sdk";

const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
const etherspay = new Etherspay(provider, {
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
});

const payment = await etherspay.createPayment({
  amount: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1"),
  currency: "ETH",
